### Starting Research
Today I started the initial research process. Planning out parts and finding out how I'm going to tackle partials and dynamics.
I found this [anemometer](https://moderndevice.com/products/wind-sensor) that could be perfect for what I need. I think I will also be using the rotary encoder to control the partial. something simillar to [this EVI](https://berglundinstruments.com/nuevi-trumpet-horn-tuba-fingering-instrument/) that I found
I also created the kicad document and this repo
